## once you've gone through processing your fastq files, this is my next step in calling variants in your population
## you will need BCFtools, SAMtools, gatk, and all their dependencies

cd PATH/TO/FILES

## you will need to create a file that is a list of all the individuals you want variant calling performed on. For simplicity, I am going to assume that all the files in your cd that end in "s.bam" are what we want, because that's what we ended with in the last code file.
ls *s.bam > bam.list
  
## what do these parameters mean???
    # -q 30 = sets the minimum mapping quality allowed for a read to be included in the pileup (ranges from 0-60, Phred-scaled). 30 indicates a 99.9% confidence that the read was correctly aligned to the genome. I have it set this high since I want to avoid multi-mapping.
    # -Q 20 = sets the minimum base quality allowed for a read to be included in the pileup (ranges from 0-40, Phred-scaled). Represents the probablity of a base having been sequenced incorrectly. 20 indicates a 99% confidence that the base call is correct.
    # --max-BQ 40 = sets the maximum base quality allowed. Since the scale should range from 0-40, this just ensures no bases are incorrectly inflated for whatever reason.
    # -m = allows for multiallelic calling (i.e. not just biallelic)
## site information
    # AD = allelic depth = number of reads present for each allele. Typically comma-separated. E.g AD=10,5 where the reference has 10 reads and the alternate has 5.
    # DP = depth of coverage = total number of reads covering that site (basically AD for all alleles, summed).
    # SP = Strand Bias P-value = indicates whether there is strand bias for a certain allele. E.g. if a site has a low strand bias p-value, there is strong evidence that the allele is a systematic/sequencing error rather than a true variant.
    # GQ = genotype quality = confidence in the assigned genotype for that individual at that site (ranges from 0-99, Phred-scaled). 
    # GP = genotype posterior probability = the likelihood for all the genotypes at that site for that individual. Typically comma-separated. E.g. GP=0.9,0.1,0.0 where there is a 0.9 probability the individual is homozygous for the reference allele. 

##variant calling
bcftools mpileup -b bam.list -f ./PATH/TO/GENOME.fa -q 30 -Q 20 --max-BQ 40 -O z -I -a AD,DP,SP | \
bcftools call -O z -v -m -f GQ,GP -o VCF.vcf.gz

##variant filtering
bcftools view -i 'DP > 10 & DP < 100 & GQ > 20 & QUAL > 30 & F_MISSING < 0.90' VCF.vcf.gz -o filtered_VCF.vcf.gz

bcftools index -t filtered_VCF.vcf.gz
