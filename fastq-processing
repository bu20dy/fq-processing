## adapter and quality trimming using bbduk
  ## "for every i that ends in _R1.fq.gz, perform this process"
  ## this removes common sequence adapters and trims both ends of reads, as necessary due to drops in quality
  ## this works for paired and unpaired read data, so long as the pairs start the same and end with eith "_R1" or "_R2" which is common. Change as needed.
