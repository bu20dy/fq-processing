## adapter and quality trimming using bbduk
  ## "for every i that ends in _R1.fq.gz, perform this process"
  ## this removes common sequence adapters and trims both ends of reads, as necessary due to drops in quality
  ## this works for paired and unpaired read data, so long as the pairs start the same and end with eith "_R1" or "_R2" which is common. Change as needed. 
for i in `ls -1 *_R1.fq.gz | sed 's/_R1.fq.gz//'`

## sam to binary format
  ## many downstream processes prefer to work with .bam files since they are smaller

## create bai files for new sorted files
